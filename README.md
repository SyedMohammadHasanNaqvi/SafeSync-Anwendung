# Personal Drive

This project aims to build a cloud storage service, similar to Google Drive, where users
can upload, download and manage their files securely.


## Current Features
- FrontendUI: The program has a basic structual UI from which the user may access their files.
- LoginUI: The login functionality is implemented through the creation of two distict classes;
one for user authentication and another for managing user registration.

### Next Steps
- We need implement the functionality for the file upload and download buttons, as well as enhance
the security mechanisms of the user authentication system.
